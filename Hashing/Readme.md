# Hashing

## So what is hashing ?
- Hashing is the method to generate a unique value for a input termed as key, a good hashing fuction will generate a value for a key and will not generate the same value for any other key, this means that a even if the key is permutated in any manner than its hash value will change.

- Hashing is used  to implement Hash table, which if implimented properly garuntee that the seach delete and insert time of O(1).
- Some method of Hashing are 
  -  Hashing by Division 
  -  Hashing by multiplication

- Some method of Implimenting the Hash table are 
  - Direct Addressing 
  - Chaining
  - Universal Hashing
  - Open Addressing 
  - - This method ensure that for some specific input keys one can't generate same hash Value.
